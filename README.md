# Pushswap Mechanical Turk

This repository contains the implementation of the Pushswap algorithm using the Mechanical Turk approach. Pushswap is a sorting algorithm specifically designed for integer arrays. The Mechanical Turk variant leverages the concept of outsourcing computational tasks to humans, mimicking the historical practice where a human chess player would make moves dictated by a "Turk" automaton.

## Introduction
Pushswap is a sorting algorithm that operates on two stacks, named `A` and `B`. The algorithm sorts the `A` stack in ascending order using a set of operations defined for stack manipulation. The Mechanical Turk version of Pushswap involves outsourcing the decision-making process of selecting optimal moves to human participants, who provide instructions based on the current state of the stacks.

## Usage
To utilize Pushswap Mechanical Turk, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Prodaturu/Pushswap_MechanicalTurk.git
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd Pushswap_MechanicalTurk
3. Run the Pushswap algorithm that uses Mechanical Turk algo to sort the stack:
./pushswap_mechanical_turk <integer_array>
4.Replace `<integer_array>` with the array you want to sort.
